## Sample Space and Random Events

In nature, people often encounter two types of phenomena:

-   One is the **deterministic phenomenon**, which is characterized by conditions under which the result is completely predictable, that is, the same result is observed each time the experiment is conducted. For example, water at 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure inevitably boils.

-   The other is the **random phenomenon**, which is characterized by conditions under which the result cannot be determined with certainty before it occurs, that is, one of several possible outcomes is observed each time the experiment is conducted. For example, when a coin is tossed, the outcome is either heads H or tails T, but unknown before the coin is tossed. Die rolling is also a random phenomenon, whose outcome is an integer from 1 to 6, unknown before the die is rolled. Likewise, for a bi-allelic gene A, the possible alleles are A and a, and the possible corresponding genotypes are AA, Aa, and aa.


The process of obtaining an observation or making a measurement for a random
phenomenon/process is called a **random experiment** (briefly, an experiment), and is denoted by E.



The **sample space Ω** is defined as the set of **all** possible outcomes of the experiment. In the case of the roll of a die, the sample space can be written as the set of the six possible outcomes, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. 

Different experiments will have different sample spaces that can be written in an equivalent way (flipping a coin: Ω ={H, T}, flipping two coins: Ω ={HH, HT, TH, TT}, testing for possible genotypes of a bi-allelic gene A: Ω ={AA, Aa, aa}).


A **random event A**, or event A for short, is a sub-set of Ω, A ⊂ Ω, and it represents **a number** of possible outcomes for the experiment. In the case of the roll of a die, the event “even number” may be represented by A = {2, 4, 6}, and the event “odd number” as B = {1, 3, 5}.
In the case of flipping two coins, an event could be that exactly one of the coins lands Heads, A = {HT, TH}.



:::{.callout-note}

For each experiment, two events always exist: the sample space itself which comprises all possible outcomes and the empty set that contains no outcomes represented as A = ∅ and called the impossible event.

## Probability

The concept of probability is used in day-to-day life which stands for the probability of occurring or non-occurring of events.

There are a number of ways of looking at probability and we describe two as the "Frequentist" and "Bayesian" approach.

**A. Frequentist approach**


Consider performing an experiment a large number N of times, under the same
experimental conditions. The occurrence of the event A is indicated as the number N(A). The probability of event A is given by:



$$ P(A) = \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{N(A)}{N}$$ {#eq-probability}

that is, the probability is the relative frequency of occurrence of a given event from many repetitions of the same experiment. 


:::{.callout-important}

The obvious limitation of this definition is the need to perform the experiment a large number of times. This requirement is not only time consuming but also requires that the experiment be repeatable in the first place, which may or may not be possible.
The limitation of this method is evident by considering a coin toss: no matter the number of tosses, the occurrence of heads up will never be exactly 50%, which is what one would expect based on an empirical knowledge of the experiment at hand.

## Probability distributions for Discrete Outcomes

## Probability distributions for Continuous Outcomes

### **Normal Distribution**

We have mentioned the normal distribution several times in this textbook with the promise we would provide more detail later. In this section, we will explore the normal distribution, why it matters, and how we can tell if our distribution is normal or not.

#### Historical background and main properties

There are several important probability distributions in statistics. However, the normal distribution might be the most important. A normal distribution is the familiar "bell curve" and it's a way of formalizing a distribution where observations cluster around some central tendency. Observations farther from the central tendency occur less frequently. First, Galileo informally described a normal distribution in 1632 when discussing the random errors from observations of celestial phenomena. However, Galileo existed before the time of differential equations and derivatives. We owe its formalization to Carl Friedrich Gauss, which is why the normal distribution is often called a Gaussian distribution. A very familiar example is the height for adult people that approximates a normal distribution very well.

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
y <- dnorm(x)

plot(x,y, main="Normal Distribution", type = "l", lwd = 2,  xlab = "", ylab = "Probability Density", xaxt='n', frame.plot = FALSE)
axis(1, at = -3:3, lab=expression(-3*sigma, -2*sigma,-1*sigma, mu, 1*sigma, 2*sigma, 3*sigma))

```

 

The Normal distribution has the properties summarized as follows:

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Properties of Normal Distribution

-   Bell shaped and symmetrical around the mean. Shape statistics, skewness and excess kurtosis are zero.

-   The peak of the curve lies above the mean

-   Any position along the horizontal axis (x-axis) can be expressed as a number of standard deviations from the mean

-   All three measures of central tendency, the mode (most frequently occurring value), the median (the middlemost value), and the mean (the statistical average), will be the same.

-   The total area under the curve equals to 1 (or 100%)

### The mathimatical type

Gauss' normal distribution, technically a density function, is a distribution defined by two parameters, mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The mean, $\mu$, represents the population mean and is a "location parameter", which defines the central tendency. The variance, $\sigma^2$ is the "scale parameter", which defines the width of the distribution and how short the distribution is. It's formally given as @eq-gauss:

$$ f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}} $$ {#eq-gauss}

Populations with small values of the standard deviation, $\sigma$, have a distribution concentrated close to the centre, $\mu$; those with large standard deviation, $\sigma$, have a distribution widely spread along the measurement axis @fig-compare_normal.

x <- seq(-6, 6, length=200)

plot(x,y1, main="Normal Distribution", type = "l", lwd = 3,  xlab = "", ylab = "Probability Density", xaxt='n', frame.plot = FALSE)
axis(1, at = c(0, 2), lab = expression(mu[1], mu[2]))
lines(x,y2,col="deeppink", lwd = 3)
text(1.0, 0.4, expression(mu[1] < mu[2]), col="gray30")

plot(x,y1, main="Normal Distributions", type = "l", lwd = 3,  xlab = "", ylab = "Probability Density", xaxt='n', frame.plot = FALSE)
axis(1, at = -4:4, lab=expression(-4*sigma, -3*sigma, -2*sigma,-1*sigma, mu, 1*sigma, 2*sigma, 3*sigma, 4*sigma))
lines(x,y3,col="deeppink", lwd = 3)
text(1.5, 0.3, expression(sigma[1]))
text(2.9, 0.10, expression(sigma[2]), col="deeppink")
text(2.5, 0.20, expression(sigma[1] < sigma[2]), col="gray30")
```

The ensuing distribution will look like this in a simple case where $\mu$ is 0 and $\sigma^2$ is 1 (Standard Normal distribution).

### Individual components of a normal distribution

We can break down individual components of a normal distribution and explain them until they seem more accessible.

**First**, the "kernel" is the part inside the exponent of the above equation (i.e. $\ {-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}$). Observe, for a simple case where $\mu$ = 0 and $\sigma^2$ = 1 that this part becomes $\ -{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}$ that is a negative parabola (notice the square term). The minus sign just flips the basic parabola $\ {\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}$ downward.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-basic_parabola
#| fig-height: 4.0
#| fig-width: 8.0
#| fig-cap: (a) A basic parabola and (b) a negative parabola.

parab <- function(x) {x^2/2}
parab2 <- function(x) {-x^2/2}


p_parab <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = parab, color="#522d80", size=1.5) +
  theme_steve() + 
  post_bg() +
  labs(title="A basic parabola",
       x = "", y="") +
theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(size= 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8))

p_parab2 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = parab2, color="#522d80", size=1.5) +
  theme_steve() + post_bg() +
  labs(title="A Negative Parabola",
       subtitle = "Notice the height is at 0 because the negative part \nflipped the parabola downward.",
       x = "", y="") +
theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(size= 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8))


p_parab + p_parab2
```

**Second**, exponentiating the negative parabola ($\  e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}}$) makes it asymptote to 0.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-neg_parabola
#| fig-height: 4.2
#| fig-width: 6.0
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: An exponentiated negative parabola.



expparab <- function(x) {exp(-x^2/2)}

p_expparab <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = expparab, color="#522d80", size=1.5) +
  theme_steve() + 
  post_bg() +
  labs(title="An Exponentiated Negative Parabola",
       subtitle = "Exponentiating squeezes the parabola, adjusts the height, and makes \nthe tails asymptote to 0.",
       x = "", y="") +
theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(size= 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8))

p_expparab
```

Notice the tails in the above graph are asymptote to 0. "Asymptote" is a fancier way of saying the tails approximate 0 but never touch or surpass 0. One way of thinking about this as we build toward its inferential implications is that deviations farther from the central tendency are increasingly "unlikely".

**Third**, and with the above point in mind, it should be clear that $\ {\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}$ will scale the height of the distribution. Observe that in our simple case where $\mu$ is 0 and $\sigma^2$ is 1, the height of the exponentiated parabola is at 1. That gets multiplied by $\ {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}$ to equal about 0.398.

**Fourth**, the normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical. The mean, $\mu$ determines the location of the distribution as well as its central tendency. All three measures of central tendency, the mode (most frequently occurring value), the median (the middlemost value), and the mean (the statistical average), will be the same. It also means a given observation of x will be as far from $\mu$ as -x. Additionally, the statistical moments of skewness and excess kurtosis are zero.

**Fifth**, we noted the normal distribution as a function and not a probability because the probability of any one value is effectively zero.

### Normal Density Plot with Shaded Regions

Importantly, much of the area (68%) of the distribution is between -sd and sd, the large majority (95%) between -2 sd and +2 sd, and almost all (99%) between -3 sd and + 3 sd. So, the probability that x is between 1 on either side of the $\mu$ of 0 is effectively 0.68. The ease of this interpretation is why researchers like to standardize their variables so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation (i.e. the scale parameter) is 1.

#| echo: false
#| label: fig-auc
#| fig-height: 7.2
#| fig-width: 12.0
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: The area underneath a normal distribution


normal_dist("#522d80","#F66733") + 
  theme_steve() + post_bg() +
    labs(title = "The Area Underneath a Normal Distribution",
       subtitle = "The tails extend to infinity and are asymptote to zero, but the full domain sums to 1. The 95% of all possible values are within about 1.96 standard units from the mean.",
       y = "Density",
       x = "")
```

The normal distribution appears as a foundation assumption for a lot of quantitative approaches to frequentist statistics.

In summary, the normal density function is technically unbounded. It has just the two parameters that define its location and scale and the tails are asymptote to 0 no matter what the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are. This makes the distribution continuous since x can range over the entire line from $\ -\infty$ to $\ +\infty$. Thus, the function does not reveal the probability of x (the probability of any one value is effectively 0). However, the area under the curve is the full domain of the probability space and sums to 1. The probability of selecting a number between two points on the x-axis equals the area under the curve between those two points.

# The polygon follows the density curve where 1 <= x <= 2
region.x <- x[1 <= x & x <= 2] # subset from x satisfying the condition
region.y <- y[1 <= x & x <= 2] # subset from y satisfying the condition
# We add initial and final segments, which drop down to the Y axis
region.x <- c(region.x[1], region.x, tail(region.x,1))
region.y <- c(0,region.y,0)


plot(x, y, main="Standard Normal Distribution with a Shaded Region",
type='l', ylab="Density", xlab="x",lwd=3,col="#522d80")
abline(h=0) # adds the x-axis to the plot
polygon(region.x, region.y, density=-1, col="#F66733")

```

To find the area between x = 1 and x = 2, we must integrate the @eq-gauss as following:

$$ E(x)=\int_{1}^{2}f(x)dx $$ {#eq-integral}

 

#### Properties of an approximately bell-shaped histogram

In an approximately **bell-shaped (normal)** distribution:

-   the mean, the median and the mode have very close values

-   the histogram is symmetric about the mean

-   "nearly all" values (99.7%) are within -3 and +3 standard deviations of the mean

-   the measure of skewness takes values close to zero (symmetric distribution) (@fig-skew2 b). Particularly, values between −1 and +1 indicate an approximate bell-shaped curve.

-   the measure of excess kurtosis is close to 0 (mesokurtic) (@fig-kurtosis b). A kurtosis value between −1 and +1 indicates normality.

#### **t-distribution**

#### **Chi-squared distribution**

#### **F-distribution**

::: callout-tip
**Statistical moments (or shape statistics) and normality**

There are two shape statistics that can indicate deviation from normality: **skew** and **kurtosis**.

**Skewness**

Skewness is usually described as a measure of a dataset's symmetry -- or lack of symmetry.

Skewness values that are **negative** indicate a tail to the **left** (@fig-skew2 a), **zero** value indicate a **symmetric** distribution (@fig-skew2 b), while values that are **positive** indicate a tail to the **right** (@fig-skew2 c).

Skewness values between −1 and +1 indicate an approximate bell-shaped curve. Values from −1 to −3 or from +1 to +3 indicate that the distribution is tending away from a bell shape with \>1 indicating moderate skewness and \>2 indicating severe skewness. Any values above +3 or below−3 are a good indication that the variable is not normally distributed.

#| fig-cap: A distribution can be (a) skewed to the left, (b) symmetric, or (c) skewed to the right.


knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "skew2.png"))
```

 

**Kurtosis**

The other way that distributions can deviate from normality is **kurtosis**. The kurtosis parameter is a measure of the combined weight of the tails relative to the rest of the distribution. Kurtosis is associated indirect with the peak of the distribution (if the peak of the distribution is too high or too low).

Distributions with **negative** excess kurtosis are called ***platykurtic*** (@fig-kurtosis a). If the measure of excess kurtosis is **0** the distribution is **mesokurtic** (@fig-kurtosis b). Finally, distributions with **positive** excess kurtosis are called ***leptokurtic*** (@fig-kurtosis c).

A kurtosis value between −1 and +1 indicates normality and a value between −1 and −3 or between +1 and +3 indicates a tendency away from normality. Values below −3 or above +3 strongly indicate non-normality.
