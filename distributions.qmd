## Sample Space and Random Events

In nature, people often encounter two types of **phenomena**:

-   One is the **deterministic phenomenon**, which is characterized by conditions under which the result is completely predictable, that is, the same result is observed each time the experiment is conducted. For example, water at 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure inevitably boils.

-   The other is the **random phenomenon**, which is characterized by conditions under which the result cannot be determined with certainty before it occurs, that is, one of several possible outcomes is observed each time the experiment is conducted. For example, when a coin is tossed, the outcome is either heads H or tails T, but unknown before the coin is tossed. Die rolling is also a random phenomenon, whose outcome is an integer from 1 to 6, unknown before the die is rolled. Likewise, for a bi-allelic gene A, the possible alleles are A and a, and the possible corresponding genotypes are AA, Aa, and aa.

The process of obtaining an observation or making a measurement for a random phenomenon/process is called a **random experiment** (briefly, an experiment), and is denoted by E.

The **sample space Ω** is defined as the set of **all** possible outcomes of the experiment. In the case of the roll of a die, the sample space can be written as the set of the six possible outcomes, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Different experiments will have different sample spaces that can be written in an equivalent way (flipping a coin: Ω ={H, T}, flipping two coins: Ω ={HH, HT, TH, TT}, testing for possible genotypes of a bi-allelic gene A: Ω ={AA, Aa, aa}).

A **random event A**, or event A for short, is a sub-set of Ω, A ⊂ Ω, and it represents **a number** of possible outcomes for the experiment. In the case of the roll of a die, the event "even number" may be represented by A = {2, 4, 6}, and the event "odd number" as B = {1, 3, 5}. In the case of flipping two coins, an event could be that exactly one of the coins lands Heads, A = {HT, TH}.

::: callout-note
For each experiment, two events always exist: the **sample space** itself which comprises all possible outcomes and the **empty set** that contains no outcomes represented as **A = ∅** and called the impossible event.
:::

## Probability

The concept of probability is used in day-to-day life which stands for the probability of occurring or non-occurring of events.

The first step towards determining the probability of an event is to establish a number of **basic rules** that capture the meaning of probability. The probability of an event is required to satisfy three **axioms** defined by **Kolmogorov**:

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## **The Kolmogorov Axioms**

1.  The probability of an event A is a non-negative number, **P(A) ≥ 0**
2.  The probability of all possible outcomes, or sample space, is **P(Ω) = 1**
3.  If A and B are two mutually exclusive events, then **P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)**
:::

These axioms should be regarded as the basic "ground rules" of the theory of probability, but they provide no guidance on how event probabilities should be assigned. For this purpose, there are **two** major avenues available. One is based on the repetition of the experiments a large number of times under the same conditions, and goes under the name of the **frequentist approach**. The other is based on a more theoretical knowledge of the experiment, but without the experimental requirement of a large number of repetitions, and is referred to as the **Bayesian approach**.

### Definition of Probability

**A. Frequentist approach**

Consider performing an experiment a **large number** N of times, under the same experimental conditions. The occurrence of the event A is indicated as the number N(A). The probability of event A is given by:

$$ P(A) = \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{N(A)}{N}$$ {#eq-probability}

that is, the probability is the relative frequency of occurrence of a given event from many repetitions of the same experiment.

The obvious **limitation** of this definition is the need to perform the experiment a **large number of times**. This requirement is not only time consuming but also requires that the experiment be repeatable in the first place, which may or may not be possible. The limitation of this method is evident by considering a **coin toss**: no matter the number of tosses, the occurrence of heads up **will never be exactly** 50%, which is what one would expect based on an empirical knowledge of the experiment at hand @fig-run.

::: callout-important

set.seed(123)
flips <- sample(c(0, 1), 500, replace = TRUE)
N <- seq(1, 500, 1)
flipsim <- data.frame(flips, N)
colnames(flipsim) <- c("Heads", "N")
flipsim[,"Cum_Heads"] <- cumsum(flipsim$Heads)

flipsim <- flipsim %>% 
  mutate(Pct_Heads = Cum_Heads/N)


flipsim %>% ggplot(aes(x = N, y = Pct_Heads)) +

  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5) +
  ylim(0, 1) + 
  transition_time(N) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
:::

Therefore, we may say that the probability of an event is the **relative frequency** of this set of outcomes over an indefinitely large number of experiments.

$$ P(A) \approx  \frac{number\ of\ times \ A\ occured}{total\ number\ of\  experiments}$$ {#eq-probability2}

::: callout-note
## Examples

**Prevalense of blood type**

Sampling many (say, 100,000) people in the Greece, finding that roughly 45,000 of them had blood type O. $$ P(O) \approx  \frac{number\ of\ people \ with\ blood\ type\ O}{total\ number\ of\  sample}= \frac{45,000}{100,000}=0.45$$ is the estimate for the probability for the event "having blood type O."

**Prevalence of a disease**

Suppose the **prevalence of diabetes** in the population is **1%**. The prevalence of a disease is the number of people in a population with the disease at a certain time divided by the number of people in the population. If a trial was then conducted by **randomly selecting one person** from the population and testing him or her for diabetes, the individual would be **expected to be diabetic with probability 0.01**. If this type of sampling of individuals from the population were repeated, then the proportion of diabetics in the total sample taken would be expected to be approximately 1%.
:::

**B. Bayesian approach**

Another method to assign probabilities is to use **knowledge** of the experiment, both theoretical and experimental, but without the need for extensive experimental data. The probability assigned to an event represents the **degree of belief** that the event will occur in a given try of the experiment, and it implies an element of subjectivity which will become more evident with Bayes' theorem.

::: callout-note
## Example - Coin toss experiment

In the coin toss experiment, the determination of the subjective probability for events "Heads up" or "Tails up" relies on the knowledge that the coin is **unbiased**, and therefore it must be true that P(T) = P(H). With this information, we can then simply use the Kolmogorov axioms to state that P(T) + P(H) = 1, and therefore obtain the intuitive result that P(T) = P(H) = 1/2.
:::

In this textbook, we'll focus on "Frequentist" approach of probability.

### Fundamental Properties of Probability

The following **properties** are useful to assign and manipulate event probabilities.

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## Fundamental Properties of Probability

1.  The probability of the null event is zero, **P(∅) = 0**.

2.  The probability of the complementary event A satisfies the property:

$$P(A) = 1 − P(A)$$ {#eq-complementary}

1.  The probability of the union of two events satisfies the general property that:

$$P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)$$ {#eq-union}
:::

### The Conditional Probability

The conditional probability is indicated as **P(A\|B)** or A **given** B. The following relationship defines the conditional probability:

$$P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) · P(B)$$ {#eq-conditional}

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Example - Conditional probability with dice

Calculate the probability of obtaining **8 as the sum of two rolls** of a die, **given that the first roll was a 3**.

It is useful to define the following two events:

-   **A** = {The sum of two rolls is 8}. The sample space consists of all ordered pairs of numbers from 1 to 6. That is, S = {(1, 1), (1, 2),… , (1, 6), (2, 1),… , (6, 6)}.


-   **B** = {The first roll shows 3}. The sample space consists of S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}


**Event A** is given by outcomes A={(2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2)} :

|              |     |       |     |     |     |
|--------------|-----|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| **1st roll** | 2   | **3** | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| **2nd roll** | 6   | **5** | 4   | 3   | 2   |
| **Sum**      | 8   | **8** | 8   | 8   | 8   |

and since each combination has a probability of 1/36, **P(A) = 5/36**.

The probability of event B is **P(B) = 1/6** since it relates to the outcomes of just one roll of the die.

Also, the event A ∩ B occurs if the first roll is a 3 and the sum is 8, which can clearly occur only if a sequence of (3,5) takes place, thus with probability **P(A ∩ B) =1/36**.

According to the definition of conditional probability @eq-conditional, the probability of interest is:

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A ∩ B)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/36}{1/6} = \frac{1}{6}$

The occurrence of 3 in the first roll has therefore **increased** the probability of A from P(A) = 5/36 to P(A\|B) = 1/6.
:::

### Statistical Independence

The concept of statistical independence among events means that the occurrence of one event has **no influence** on the occurrence of other events. Consider, for example, rolling two dice, one after the other: the outcome of one die is independent of the other and the two tosses are said to be statistically independent. 

On the other hand, consider rolling two dice, and being interested in the following pair of events: the first is the outcome of the roll of die 1 and the second is the sum the rolls of die 1 and die 2. It is clear that the outcome of the second event—e.g., the sum of both dice—depends on the first toss and the two events are not independent.

Two events A and B are said to be **statistically independent** if:

$$P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B)$$ {#eq-independent}


This definition follows directly from @eq-conditional. In fact, if A and B are statistically independent, then the conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A), i.e., the occurrence of B has no influence on the occurrence of A. A few examples illustrate the meaning of this definition.


::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Example - Statistical independence with dice

Determine the probability of obtaining two 3s when rolling two dice. This event can be decomposed in two events:

- **A** = {die 1 shows 3, and die 2 shows any number},

- **B** = {die 2 shows 3, and die 1 shows any number}.


It is natural to assume that P(A) = 1/6, P(B) = 1/6, and state that the two events A and B are independent by nature, since each event involves a different die, which has no knowledge of the outcome of the other one; the same would be true also of the same die tossed two times. The event of interest is C = A ∩ B, and the definition of probability of two statistically independent events leads to
$P(C) = P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B) = 1/36$.

This result can be confirmed by a direct count of all possible outcomes in the toss of two dice, and the fact that there is only one combination out of 36 that gives rise to two consecutive 3s.

:::



### Bayes’ theorem

The theorem can be written as:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ {#eq-bayes}

where A and B are events and $P(B)\neq 0$.


The experiment B can be considered as the data collected in a given experiment. The event A is a model that is used to describe the data.

Accordingly, the probabilities involved in Bayes’ theorem can be interpreted as follows:
(a) P(B|A) is the probability, or likelihood L, of the data given the specified
model. Notice how P(B|A) means that the model A is given, or known.
(b) P(A) is the probability of the model A, without any knowledge of the data.This term is interpreted as a prior probability, or the degree of belief that the model is true before the measurements are made.
(c) P(B) is the probability of collecting the dataset B.
(d) Finally, P(A/B) is the posterior probability of the model after the data have been collected.The posterior probability is the ultimate goal of the analysis since it describes the probability of the model based on the collection of data.

### **Normal Distribution**

We have mentioned the normal distribution several times in this textbook with the promise we would provide more detail later. In this section, we will explore the normal distribution, why it matters, and how we can tell if our distribution is normal or not.

#### Historical background and main properties

There are several important probability distributions in statistics. However, the normal distribution might be the most important. A normal distribution is the familiar "bell curve" and it's a way of formalizing a distribution where observations cluster around some central tendency. Observations farther from the central tendency occur less frequently. First, Galileo informally described a normal distribution in 1632 when discussing the random errors from observations of celestial phenomena. However, Galileo existed before the time of differential equations and derivatives. We owe its formalization to Carl Friedrich Gauss, which is why the normal distribution is often called a Gaussian distribution. A very familiar example is the height for adult people that approximates a normal distribution very well.

```

 

The Normal distribution has the properties summarized as follows:

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Properties of Normal Distribution

-   Bell shaped and symmetrical around the mean. Shape statistics, skewness and excess kurtosis are zero.

-   The peak of the curve lies above the mean

-   Any position along the horizontal axis (x-axis) can be expressed as a number of standard deviations from the mean

-   All three measures of central tendency, the mode (most frequently occurring value), the median (the middlemost value), and the mean (the statistical average), will be the same.

-   The total area under the curve equals to 1 (or 100%)
:::

 

### The mathimatical type

Gauss' normal distribution, technically a density function, is a distribution defined by two parameters, mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The mean, $\mu$, represents the population mean and is a "location parameter", which defines the central tendency. The variance, $\sigma^2$ is the "scale parameter", which defines the width of the distribution and how short the distribution is. It's formally given as @eq-gauss:

$$ f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}} $$ {#eq-gauss}

Populations with small values of the standard deviation, $\sigma$, have a distribution concentrated close to the centre, $\mu$; those with large standard deviation, $\sigma$, have a distribution widely spread along the measurement axis @fig-compare_normal.

```

The ensuing distribution will look like this in a simple case where $\mu$ is 0 and $\sigma^2$ is 1 (Standard Normal distribution).

### Individual components of a normal distribution

We can break down individual components of a normal distribution and explain them until they seem more accessible.

**First**, the "kernel" is the part inside the exponent of the above equation (i.e. $\ {-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}$). Observe, for a simple case where $\mu$ = 0 and $\sigma^2$ = 1 that this part becomes $\ -{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}$ that is a negative parabola (notice the square term). The minus sign just flips the basic parabola $\ {\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}$ downward.

parab <- function(x) {x^2/2}
parab2 <- function(x) {-x^2/2}

  stat_function(fun = parab, color="#522d80", size=1.5) +
  theme_steve() + 
  post_bg() +
  labs(title="A basic parabola",
       x = "", y="") +
theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(size= 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8))

p_parab2 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = parab2, color="#522d80", size=1.5) +
  theme_steve() + post_bg() +
  labs(title="A Negative Parabola",
       subtitle = "Notice the height is at 0 because the negative part \nflipped the parabola downward.",
       x = "", y="") +
theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(size= 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8))


p_parab + p_parab2
```

**Second**, exponentiating the negative parabola ($\  e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}}$) makes it asymptote to 0.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-neg_parabola
#| fig-height: 4.2
#| fig-width: 6.0
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: An exponentiated negative parabola.



expparab <- function(x) {exp(-x^2/2)}

p_expparab <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = expparab, color="#522d80", size=1.5) +
  theme_steve() + 
  post_bg() +
  labs(title="An Exponentiated Negative Parabola",
       subtitle = "Exponentiating squeezes the parabola, adjusts the height, and makes \nthe tails asymptote to 0.",
       x = "", y="") +
theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(size= 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 8))

p_expparab
```

Notice the tails in the above graph are asymptote to 0. "Asymptote" is a fancier way of saying the tails approximate 0 but never touch or surpass 0. One way of thinking about this as we build toward its inferential implications is that deviations farther from the central tendency are increasingly "unlikely".

**Third**, and with the above point in mind, it should be clear that $\ {\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}$ will scale the height of the distribution. Observe that in our simple case where $\mu$ is 0 and $\sigma^2$ is 1, the height of the exponentiated parabola is at 1. That gets multiplied by $\ {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}$ to equal about 0.398.

**Fourth**, the normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical. The mean, $\mu$ determines the location of the distribution as well as its central tendency. All three measures of central tendency, the mode (most frequently occurring value), the median (the middlemost value), and the mean (the statistical average), will be the same. It also means a given observation of x will be as far from $\mu$ as -x. Additionally, the statistical moments of skewness and excess kurtosis are zero.

**Fifth**, we noted the normal distribution as a function and not a probability because the probability of any one value is effectively zero.

### Normal Density Plot with Shaded Regions

Importantly, much of the area (68%) of the distribution is between -sd and sd, the large majority (95%) between -2 sd and +2 sd, and almost all (99%) between -3 sd and + 3 sd. So, the probability that x is between 1 on either side of the $\mu$ of 0 is effectively 0.68. The ease of this interpretation is why researchers like to standardize their variables so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation (i.e. the scale parameter) is 1.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-auc
#| fig-height: 7.2
#| fig-width: 12.0
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: The area underneath a normal distribution


normal_dist("#522d80","#F66733") + 
  theme_steve() + post_bg() +
    labs(title = "The Area Underneath a Normal Distribution",
       subtitle = "The tails extend to infinity and are asymptote to zero, but the full domain sums to 1. The 95% of all possible values are within about 1.96 standard units from the mean.",
       y = "Density",
       x = "")
```

The normal distribution appears as a foundation assumption for a lot of quantitative approaches to frequentist statistics.

In summary, the normal density function is technically unbounded. It has just the two parameters that define its location and scale and the tails are asymptote to 0 no matter what the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are. This makes the distribution continuous since x can range over the entire line from $\ -\infty$ to $\ +\infty$. Thus, the function does not reveal the probability of x (the probability of any one value is effectively 0). However, the area under the curve is the full domain of the probability space and sums to 1. The probability of selecting a number between two points on the x-axis equals the area under the curve between those two points.

To find the area between x = 1 and x = 2, we must integrate the @eq-gauss as following:

$$ E(x)=\int_{1}^{2}f(x)dx $$ {#eq-integral}

 

#### Properties of an approximately bell-shaped histogram

In an approximately **bell-shaped (normal)** distribution:

-   the mean, the median and the mode have very close values

-   the histogram is symmetric about the mean

-   "nearly all" values (99.7%) are within -3 and +3 standard deviations of the mean

-   the measure of skewness takes values close to zero (symmetric distribution) (@fig-skew2 b). Particularly, values between −1 and +1 indicate an approximate bell-shaped curve.

-   the measure of excess kurtosis is close to 0 (mesokurtic) (@fig-kurtosis b). A kurtosis value between −1 and +1 indicates normality.

#### **t-distribution**

#### **Chi-squared distribution**

#### **F-distribution**

::: callout-tip
**Statistical moments (or shape statistics) and normality**

There are two shape statistics that can indicate deviation from normality: **skew** and **kurtosis**.

**Skewness**

Skewness is usually described as a measure of a dataset's symmetry -- or lack of symmetry.

Skewness values that are **negative** indicate a tail to the **left** (@fig-skew2 a), **zero** value indicate a **symmetric** distribution (@fig-skew2 b), while values that are **positive** indicate a tail to the **right** (@fig-skew2 c).

Skewness values between −1 and +1 indicate an approximate bell-shaped curve. Values from −1 to −3 or from +1 to +3 indicate that the distribution is tending away from a bell shape with \>1 indicating moderate skewness and \>2 indicating severe skewness. Any values above +3 or below−3 are a good indication that the variable is not normally distributed.

#| fig-cap: A distribution can be (a) skewed to the left, (b) symmetric, or (c) skewed to the right.


knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "skew2.png"))
```

 

**Kurtosis**

The other way that distributions can deviate from normality is **kurtosis**. The kurtosis parameter is a measure of the combined weight of the tails relative to the rest of the distribution. Kurtosis is associated indirect with the peak of the distribution (if the peak of the distribution is too high or too low).

Distributions with **negative** excess kurtosis are called ***platykurtic*** (@fig-kurtosis a). If the measure of excess kurtosis is **0** the distribution is **mesokurtic** (@fig-kurtosis b). Finally, distributions with **positive** excess kurtosis are called ***leptokurtic*** (@fig-kurtosis c).

A kurtosis value between −1 and +1 indicates normality and a value between −1 and −3 or between +1 and +3 indicates a tendency away from normality. Values below −3 or above +3 strongly indicate non-normality.
