## Statistics and Medicine

Although some healthcare professionals may not carry out medical research, they will definitely be consumers of medical research. Thus, it is incumbent on them to be able to discern high quality research studies from low quality, to be able to verify whether the conclusions of a study are valid and to understand the limitations in methods of a study. The current emphasis on evidence-based medicine (EBM) requires that healthcare professionals consider critically all evidence about whether a specific treatment works and this requires basic statistical knowledge.

Statistics is not only a discipline in its own right but it is also a fundamental tool for investigation in all biological and medical sciences. As such, any serious investigator in these fields must have a grasp of the basic principles. With modern computer facilities there is little need for familiarity with the technical details of statistical calculations. However, a healthcare professional should understand when such calculations are valid, when they are not and how they should be interpreted.

The use of statistical methods pervades the medical literature. In a survey of 350 original articles published in three UK journals of general practice: *British Medical Journal (General Practice Section)*, *British Journal of General Practice* and *Family Practice*, over a one-year period, Rigby et al. (2004) found that 66% used some form of statistical analysis. Another review by Strasak et al. (2007) of 91 original research articles published in *The New England Journal of Medicine* (one of the prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals) found an even higher percentage (95%) of using inferential statistics, for example, hypothesis testing and deriving estimates. It appears, therefore, that the majority of papers published in these journals require some statistical knowledge for a complete understanding.

To students schooled in the 'hard' sciences of physics and chemistry it may be difficult to appreciate the variability of biological data. If one repeatedly puts blue litmus paper into acid solutions it turns red 100% of the time, not most (say 95%) of the time. In contrast, if one gives aspirin to a group of people with headaches, not all of them will experience relief. Penicillin was perhaps one of the few 'miracle' cures where the results were so dramatic that little evaluation was required. Absolute certainty in medicine is rare.

Measurements on human subjects seldom give exactly the same results from one occasion to the next. For example, O' Sullivan et al (1999), found that systolic blood pressure (SBP) in normal healthy children has a wide range, with 95% of children having SBPs below 130 mmHg when they were resting, rising to 160 mmHg during the school day, and falling again to below 130 mmHg at night. Furthermore, Hansen et al. (2010) in a study of over 8000 subjects found that increasing variability in blood pressure over 24 hours was a significant and independent predictor of mortality and a cardiovascular and stroke events.

This variability is also inherent in responses to biological hazards. Most people now accept that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease, and yet nearly everyone can point to an apparently healthy 80-year-old who has smoked for many years without apparent ill effect. Although it is now known from the report of Doll et al (2004) that about half of all persistent cigarette smokers are killed by their habit, it is usually forgotten that until the 1950s, the cause of the rise in lung cancer deaths was a mystery and commonly associated with general atmospheric pollution such as the exhaust fumes of cars. It was not until the carefully designed and statistically analysed case--control and cohort studies of Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill and others, that smoking was identified as the true cause. Enstrom et al. (2003) moved the debate on to ask whether or not passive smoking causes lung cancer. This is a more difficult question to answer since the association is weaker. However, studies by Cao et al. (2015) have now shown that it is a major health problem and scientists at the International Agency for Rsearch on Cancer (IARC) have concluded that there is sufficient evidence that second-hand smoke causes lung cancer (IARC 2012). Restrictions on smoking in public places have been imposed to smokers.

With such variability, it follows that in any comparison made in a medical context, such as people on different treatments, differences are almost bound to occur. These differences may be due to real effects, random variation or variation in some other factor that may affect an outcome. It is the job of the analyst to decide how much variation should be ascribed to chance or other factors, so that any remaining variation can be assumed to be due to a real effect. This is the art of statistics.




## The discipline of statistics

The discipline of statistics includes two main branches:

* descriptive statistics

* inferential statistics

### Descriptive Statistics

The methods and techniques of descriptive statistics aim at summarizing large quantities of data by a few numbers, in a way that highlights the most important numerical features of the data.

Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, measures of position, and measures of association. They also include a description of the general shape of the distribution of the data. These terms will be explained in the corresponding chapters.


### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics aim at generalizing a measure taken on a small number of cases that have been observed, to a larger set of cases that have not been observed. Using the terms explained above, we could reformulate this aim, and say that inferential statistics aim at generalizing observations made on a sample to a whole population.




## Why Jamovi?

Jamovi is a new fee open "3rd generation" statistical software that is built on top of the programming language R (@fig-jamovi_0). Designed from the ground up to be easy to use, Jamovi is a compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as SPSS and SAS.
